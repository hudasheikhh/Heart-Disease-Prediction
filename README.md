Heart Disease Prediction
This project leverages data science and machine learning to identify patients at high risk of heart disease. Using a dataset of 300+ patient records, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing in Excel, built a classification model to predict heart disease risk, and developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize insights for healthcare stakeholders.

üîç Key Highlights
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and structured patient data using Excel.

Machine Learning: Trained a classification model to detect high-risk individuals.

Data Visualization: Created a Tableau dashboard to support decision-making in clinical settings.

This end-to-end project demonstrates the power of data-driven healthcare solutions‚Äîfrom raw data to actionable insights.
